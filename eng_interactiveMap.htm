            Campo Grande is a neighbourhood in Lisbon, with 10 514 inhabitants (2011). 
    Density: 4 291.4 hab/km².
    It is in this neighbourhood that is located the University City of Lisbon (Cidade Universitária), the largest higher education campus in the country, and the University of Lisbon.
    This is where our adventure begins, at the Faculty of Sciences, a public education institution for teaching and research in the areas of natural and exact sciences.
    It was created on April 19, 1911, but its origins date back to the creation of the Royal Navy Academy in 1779 and its successor, the Escola Politécnica de Lisboa in 1837. From 1911 to 1985 (when it was relocated to its current premises in Cidade Universitária, in Lisbon) it was installed in the former building of the Escola Politécnica, whose premises are now used as a museum.

            Praça do Duque de Saldanha is one of the main squares in the city of Lisbon, shared by the parishes of Arroios and Avenidas Novas. It took its current designation in 1909, in honor of Marshal Duque de Saldanha.
    On the 4th of June 1904, the laying ceremony of the first stone of the monument to Marechal Saldanha was held. It was presided over by King D. Carlos, and with the presence of politicians, army officers.

            <p style="font-family:garamond; text-align:center;" >
            Parque Eduardo VII is the largest park in the center of Lisbon. Located in São Sebastião da Pedreira, current parish of Avenidas Novas, it was baptized in 1903 in honor of Edward VII of the United Kingdom, who had visited Lisbon the previous year to reaffirm the alliance between the two countries. Until then, it was designated Parque da Liberdade.
    The space it occupies extends over about twenty-five hectares. At the north end there is a viewpoint where the Monument to the 25th of April was erected and at the top of the park, in a very visible area of the city, a large Portuguese flag is hoisted.
    In the northwest corner of the park is the Estufa Fria, with a diversity of exotic plants, streams, waterfalls, palm trees and trails, fuchsias, flowering shrubs and banana trees and the Estufa Quente with lush plants, lakes and cacti as well as tropical birds.

        Praça do Marquês de Pombal, also known as Rotunda do Marquês de Pombal, is an important square in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. It is located between Avenida da Liberdade and Parque Eduardo VII. In the center stands the monument to Marquês de Pombal, inaugurated in 1934, who was Secretary of State for the Kingdom during the reign of King José I. His administration was marked by the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755, a challenge that gave him the historic role of architectural renovator of the city.

            The Amoreiras Complex is a complex of offices and housing, with a daring architecture for the time, built in the 80s of the 20th century. It was opened on the 27th of September 1985 and is located on Avenida Engenheiro Duarte Pacheco, parish of Campo de Ourique, in Lisbon. It is part of the Amoreiras Shopping Centre, which was the first large commercial and service space in an urban area in Portugal, being, at the time, the largest commercial space in the country and the fourth largest in Europe.
    The Amoreiras Complex earned its owners and its creator, architect Tomás Taveira, the award of the Valmor and Municipal Architecture Prize in 1993.

            In 1846 a fabric production plant (Companhia de Fiação e Tecidos Lisbonense), one of the most important manufacturing complexes in Lisbon, was installed in Alcântara. The industrial complex spanned over a total of 23.000 m2.
    In 2005, Mainsite, a real estate company, bought and revitalized the place that was reborn in 2008 as LXFACTORY, which kept the industrial spaces and invited companies in the arts sector, which later brought shops, cafes and restaurants. It has been the scene of a diverse range of events in the areas of fashion, advertising, communication, multimedia, art, architecture, music, etc. generating a dynamic that has attracted countless visitors to re-discover this area of Alcântara.

            Located on the riverfront of the historic area of Belém, in Lisbon, the Fundação EDP campus covers an area of 38,000 square meters that includes a converted thermoelectric power station — the Central Tejo, an emblematic building of industrial architecture built in 1908 — and a new building designed by the London-based architectural studio (Amanda Levete Architects. Both buildings host exhibitions and events scheduled by the museum and are linked by a garden designed by Lebanese landscape architect Vladimir Djurovic.
    The maat presents national and international exhibitions with the contribution of contemporary artists, architects and thinkers.

            Saboreando um Pastel de Belém
    Um Pastel de Belém quer-se crocante e estaladiço no seu exterior, ligeiramente queimado no seu centro, indicando o ponto de perfeita cozedura, cremoso, fresco ao paladar (sinal que o limão está na dose correta mas sem se fazer distinguir) e, quanto à temperatura, bom, desafiamo-lo a resistir a um, acabado de sair do forno.

    Pastéis de Belém
    
    In Portugal, during the Liberal Revolution, there was a rupture between the State and the Church. Thus, from 1820 onwards, the monks had to find new sources of income. And the congregation that lived in the Jerónimos Monastery, in Belém, near Lisbon at the time, was no exception. To do so, they ingeniously started selling their pastries, which were much appreciated by visitors.
    With the closure of the monastery in 1834, the famous recipe was sold and kept at the local sugar refinery. Three years later the refinery's owners opened the Pastéis de Belém factory, which has remained in the hands of the same family for six generations. 
    Over time the premise has remained the same: only three people know the secret recipe that is particularly well guarded. They are the soul of a million-dollar business, subject to strict contractual clauses regarding secrecy - and when one of the recipe's owners retires, another contract is signed to perpetuate the legacy. 
    
    Tasting a Pastel de Belém
    
    A Pastel de Belém is crispy and crunchy on the outside, slightly burnt in the centre, indicating the point of perfect cooking, creamy, fresh to the palate (a sign that the lemon is in the right dose but without making itself distinct) and, as for the temperature, well, we challenge you to resist one, fresh out of the oven.
